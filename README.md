# wowshuxkluh

[This repo is in the earliest stage of development. Initial TDD work is being done.]

Wowshuxkluh will be an an Angular 1.x library for Ionic.js that manages the connection between mobile devices and Animist IOT nodes. The goal is to enable mobile clients to authenticate iBeacon proximity events for a specified Ethereum account such that they determine the execution path of any Ethereum contracts which reference them in relation to the IOT node. 

Key issues here include:

iBeacon signal management
Ethereum account management (Lightwallet)
BlueTooth authentication between IOT Node and mobile device
